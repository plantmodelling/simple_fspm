### Photosynthetic active radiation [Âµmol/m2/sec]

Maximal photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) reached during the day. The evolution of PAR follows a parabolic curve, with its maximal at noon. 

This will have an effect on the **carbon production** (photosynthesis) and **transpiration** (stomato openning).
