### Leaf apparition rate [-]

In the model, leaves are produced at time intervals, based on the sum of degree/days. The interval can be modified, to explore its effect on the plant development. 

- 1 = no modification
- 0.1 = **divide** the base value by 10
- 10 = **multiply** the base value by 10

This will have an effect on the **carbon production** (photosynthesis) and **transpiration**.
