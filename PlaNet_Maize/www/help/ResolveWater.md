### Solve water fluxes

The simulation be can run with and without a resolution of water fluxes in the plant. 

IMPORTANT: carbon fluxes cannot be run if water fluxe are disabled

#### Water movement in the plant

The network of articles intervening in the uptake and transport of water in the plant can be conveniently analyzed using the analogy with an electric circuit (Landsberg and Fowkes, 1978). A such, we can define equations for the radial and axial flow of water, based on the distribution of water potential in each article, their geometry and their hydraulic properties. At each timestep, the equations are specified for every plant segment and are assembled as a system of linear equations that is solvable for all articles that comprise the plant.
