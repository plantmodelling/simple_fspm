### Maximal length of lateral roots [cm]

In most plants, lateral root do not grow for ever. Once reaching a maximal size, they stop growing. the maximal size of laterals is highly variable between genotypes. 

This will have an effect on the **carbon demand** of the root system and **water uptake capacity** (increased root surface)
