### Root / shoot partinioning ratio [-]

The root / shoot partinioning ratiois used when allocation the carbon ressources to the plant.

- 0.5 = equal amount of carbon to both root and shoot
- > 0.5 = more carbon to the root
- < 0.5 = more carbon to the shoot

This will affect the **global architecture** of the plant, the **photosynthesis**, the **water uptake**
