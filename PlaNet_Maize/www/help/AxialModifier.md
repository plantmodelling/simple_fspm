### Root axial conductivity [-]

This parameter varies the axial conductivity of the different root segments. 

- 1 = no modification
- 0.1 = **divide** the base conductivity by 10
- 10 = **multiply** the base conductivity by 10

This will have an effet of the **uptake capacity** of the plant. The larger the axial conductivity, the easier the water can be transported within the roots.
