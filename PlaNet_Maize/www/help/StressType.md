### Stress type

Type of water stress to impose to the plant.

- **None** = soil water potential is kept constant at the value defined by the *Initial soil water potential* parameter. 
- **Gradual drying** = soil water potential decrease at the time define by *Stress start* parameter. Soil can be rewatered (back to the original value) at the time set by the *Rewatering start* parameter.
