### Leaf growth rate [cm/Â°D

Leaf growth rate is computed as a function of degree/days (not days directly). Higher temperature will then result in faster leaf growth. 

The value can be changed to see the effect on the palnt development as a whole. 

This will have an effect on the **carbon production** (photosynthesis) and **transpiration**.
