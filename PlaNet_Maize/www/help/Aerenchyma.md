### Proportion of root aerenchyma [-]

This parameter varies the proportion of aerenchyma in the roots

- 0 = no aerenchyma
- 0.5 = 50% of cortex cells are considee as aerenchyma
- 0.9 = 90% of cortex cells are considee as aerenchyma

This will have an effet of the **carbon demand** of the roots. As aerenchyma are dead cells, high proportion of aerenchyma means lower maintenance cost.
